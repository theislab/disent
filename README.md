Extracting Interpretable Latent Spaces for scRNA-seq Using Disentangled Representations 

## Usage

Reproducing results from Jupyter Notebooks:
* JN1_train.ipynb - loads, normalizes and trains the data
* JN2_kang_analysis.ipynb - further analyses the trained model for Kang dataset. It calculates both types of disentanglement scores and also visualizes the latent space as well as gene-feature space plots.
* JN3_dentate_analysis.ipynb - further analyses the trained model for Dentate Gyrus dataset.
* JN4_Out of Sample Prediction.ipynb - implements Out of Sample Prediction and analyses the results further
* Model Comparisons folder provides the notebooks to reproducs the model architecture comparison plots.
